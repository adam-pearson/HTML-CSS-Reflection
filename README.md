# HTML-CSS-Reflection

This project is about recreating the Netmatters homepage with HTML & Sass. I'm able to use Bootstrap or flexbox, and I have chosen to complete this project with flexbox.

I'm using the Live Sass Compiler extension for VS Code to compile my Sass, and also the Live Server extension to view my changes in realtime.
